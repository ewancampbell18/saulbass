    <title>Saul Bass</title>
    <h1>How has Saul Bass influenced design throughout the film industry? </h1>
    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <div class="font">
        <p>In the early 1950s Saul Bass became famous in the design world for his design of motion-picture title sequences, film posters and corporate images.  Before Bass, the importance of a title sequence within the filmmaking industry was not seen as a major priority for the film itself.  However Saul Bass would argue that “The audience involvement with a film should really begin with the first frame” so therefore a title sequence is just one more building block to the film overall.  During his 40 year career Bass got the opportunity to have worked alongside a few of Hollywood’s most eminent filmmakers to influence and change the design within the film industry.</p></div>

    <h2 id="life">Early Life</h2>
    <div class="pull">
        <p>Saul bass (1920-1996) was an American graphic designer and Oscar-winning filmmaker.  He graduated from James Monroe High School and then studied part-time at the Art Students League in Manhattan until he attended classes with Gyorgy Kepes at Brooklyn College, who greatly influenced Bass’ work.  Bass attended further education later on in his life due to the need of having to support his family.</p>
        
        <p>Bass worked alongside a few of Hollywood’s most eminent filmmakers in order to make some very well known title sequences that we know and see today.  His career began during the 1940s as a graphic designer, creating movie posters and marketing material for different companies and brands.  He worked for advertisement until 1952 where he then set up his own practice, Saul Bass Associates.</p>
        
        <p>Bass’ involvement with Hollywood began when he started designing posters for movies.  This led him to meet and begin working alongside director, Otto Preminger.  Bass designed the marketing material for the film ‘Carmen Jones’ which impressed Preminger so much that he brought Bass on board for ‘The Man with the Golden Arm’ movie in 1955.  The title sequence for that film provided so much success for its simplicity, and its effectiveness of portraying the theme of the film in a short sequence.  From this Bass became extremely popular within the film making industry.  Saul Bass has greatly influenced graphic design by launching graphic design in the film industry through the use of title sequences.</p></div>

    <h2 id="title-seq">Title Sequences</h2>
    <div class="closer">  </div>
    <div class="pull">
        <p>Bass seen title sequences as a successful way to engage with the audience immediately and lure the audience into the themes and feelings that would be found within the movie itself.  Bass used many different mediums in creating title sequences which allowed him to be creative and innovative, and therefore make distinct and unique sequences for each film.  His techniques included visual imagery, music, typography and many others.  Bass predominately employed the use of shape within all his title sequences.  For example, the title sequence for Otto Preminger’s ‘The Man with the Golden Arm’ was to create an effective title sequence.  The sequence was a series of geometric white blocks appearing upon the screen, creating abstract patterns.</p>
            
        <p>Bass’s simplistic style meant that his title sequences could be portrayed easily to the audience.  However, it wasn’t until the 1960s when Bass developed his understanding for making the audience fully connect at the beginning on the film.  The title sequence for Stanley Kramer’s 1963 Film ‘Its a Mad, Mad, Mad World’ was a perfect rendition of what would later be portrayed in the film.  The title sequence consisted of a world globe with multiple moving graphics going on and happening at a fast pace.  This gives the audience a quick look at the chaos that will occur as ‘a group of diverse and colourful strangers embark on a madcap pursuit of £350,000 in stolen cash’ in a short space of time.  The title sequence for that film fit perfectly alongside the film itself, which was why Bass became one of the most sought after filmmakers in Hollywood of his time.</p>
        
        <p>Bass’ greatest skill was being able to create a title sequence which hinted at the film follow, without ruining or spoiling the plot.  Bass always took great thought and care about the content of the film before making the title sequence.  For example, 1961’s motion picture of ‘West Side Story’ ends with violent deaths of the main characters.  Bass thought the audience would appreciate the titles being at the end of the film, so they had time to gather themselves and reflect on the final moments of the film before the lights came up.  Since this film, Bass really took title placement into consideration.  Either he either gave the audience a quick insight into the film before, or he gave the audience time to reflect after.</p>
        
        <p>Bass strongly influenced the film industry throughout the making of his famous title sequences.  Before title sequences were changed by Bass, an opening title wasn’t obligatory.  They were dull with no visual design components.  Saul Bass revolutionised the function of a title sequence by making them be an introduction to the film in a fun, intriguing and visual way.  He has changed the whole definition of a title sequence, which ended up in him influencing fellow film designers, film directors and the world of design itself due to his extensive thought and care, his unique designs and his overall concepts.</p></div>

    <h2>Film Posters</h2>
    <div class="pull">
        <p>Bass’ goal when creating movie posters was to reduce the movies themes and feelings into as simple of an image as he possibly could.  Bass became very well known for his simplistic, minimal and symbolic poster designs.  He would often use a limited colour palette, with black shapes over the top of it to create an image, alongside a typeface that would fit with the overall theme of the film.  His use of image and colour helps to keep his posters simplistic and easy for the audience to grasp.  An example of one of Bass’ effective yet minimalistic movie posters was the poster for 1963 film ‘The Man with the Golden Arm’.  Bass utilised geometric shapes in order to create a disjointed image of a mans arm.  This image was to reflect the disjointed life of the heroin addict in the film.</p>
            
        <p>Bass was always thinking of ways to be innovative and revolutionary to the film industry throughout all his design work.  Bass’s use of bold graphic components, negative space, blocks of bright colour and silhouetted abstract bodies was an enlightening and influential strike within film advertising in the 1950’s.  His poster designs were fresh and modern to the era, a strong example was his poster design for ‘Vertigo’.  His design for this poster was a pivotal moment in his career due to the striking visuals and graphics.  Bass showed off his creative tendencies in this poster due to choosing a limited colour palette.  Having all the visuals in black makes it easy for the eye to focus upon them.  Bass also included a white spiral which forces the eye towards the centre of the poster where the visuals are placed, yet he also used this design element to directly reference the film, as spirals were used in the opening credits of the film.</p>
        
        <p>One of the most iconic movie posters that Saul Bass designed was the poster for ‘Carmen Jones’.  The poster he designed was shockingly simple, with a still shot of actress Dorothy Dandridge in black and white, with a hint of red used on her lips and skirt to reflect the fiery, seductive character within the film. Bass wanted to break the “romantic” style used in film posters and this poster became a big part of achieving that.  Bass often uses 1 dominant colour in his posters as to not overwhelm the overall image.</p></div>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> 
        <div class="pull">
        <p>Bass’s style was considered modern for his time, especially his film sequences.  He managed to create memorably unique title film sequences due to his groundbreaking personal style.  Bass’s style was so incredibly innovative and creative that it is still a huge source off inspiration for all designers in the film making industry today.  His film sequences and movie posters changed the design world today as his open minded approach excelled time and trends.  Bass was a strong believer in that when the film began to roll, the audiences engagement should roll alongside it.  Therefore he strived to entice the audience from the beginning by introducing them to what they’re about to see before the film began.  The movement and design throughout all his title sequences is what strongly influenced design within the film industry.  Altogether Bass heavily revolutionised and influenced the film making industry with his designs for movie posters and title sequences due to his modern and minimalistic style.</p></div>
